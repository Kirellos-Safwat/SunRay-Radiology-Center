                <h4>MRI</h4>
                <p>
                    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a powerful magnetic field, radio waves and a computer to
                    produce detailed pictures of the body's internal structures that are clearer, more detailed and more
                    likely in some instances to identify and accurately characterize disease than other imaging methods.

                <h4>CT</h4>
                <p>
                    CT scanning combines special x-ray equipment with sophisticated computers to produce multiple images
                    or pictures of the inside of the body. These cross-sectional images of the area being studied can
                    then be examined on a computer monitor, printed or transferred to a CD.

                <p>
                    Nuclear medicine is a branch of medical imaging that uses small amounts of radioactive material to
                    diagnose and determine the severity of or treat a variety of diseases including many types of
                    cancers, heart disease, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological disorders
                    and other abnormalities within the body.

                    Conventional ultrasound displays the images in thin, flat sections of the body. Advancements in
                    ultrasound technology include three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound that formats the sound wave data
                    into 3-D images. Four-dimensional (4-D) ultrasound is 3-D ultrasound in motion.

                <p>
                    Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the Body to a small dose of ionizing radiation to
                    produce pictures of the inside of the body. X-rays
                    are the oldest and most frequently used form of medical imaging.
